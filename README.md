**CLIMATE CHANGE**

Climate change is the long-term alteration of our climate due to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the Sun, resulting in the gradual heating of the Earth known as "global warming". The doubling of reported CO2 in the atmosphere, coupled with the increase of the Earth's temperature by over 1 degrees Celsius has lead to some adverse effects within the global ecosystem. For one, species across the globe are going extinct at hundreds of times their normal rate. The severity of this situation has lead to what's known as the "6th mass extinction". Secondly, the prevalence of CO2 in the atmosphere has lead algae to spread rapidly throughout our oceans, resulting in a process known as "eutrophication" which effectively suffocates other marine animals to death by lack of oxygen. Third, melting ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica can lead to sea level rise by up to several feet, submerging many coastal cities and island nations beneath the waters. Finally, climate change has reduced crop yields throughout the agricultural world, potentially leading to resource wars and devastation between rich and poor.

Therefore, it is for these reasons that we have chosen climate change as the topic for our projects in Computer Science 3. üëèüëèüëè

The webpage will comprised of the following:

1. Homepage - The homepage is the landing page of the website and will give an overview of the website and links to the other contents of the website.

2. Fossil Fuels 101 - This page will discuss what fossil fuels are and why does it affect climate change. Aside from this, this page will also tell us how big is the impact of fossil fuels on the climate change and our planet. 

3. Deforestation - In this page, we will talk through what is deforestation and its relationship to climate change. 

4. Clean Energy (work in progress) - 

5. Solutions (work in progress) -
