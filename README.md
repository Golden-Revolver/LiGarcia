<h1> CLIMATRON </h1>

<br> <strong> I. About Our Topic </strong> <br>

Climate change is the long-term alteration of our climate due to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat from the Sun, resulting in the gradual heating of the Earth known as "global warming". The doubling of reported CO2 in the atmosphere, coupled with the increase of the Earth's temperature by over 1 degrees Celsius has led to some adverse effects within the global ecosystem. 

For one, species across the globe are going extinct at hundreds of times their normal rate due to their inability to adapt to the ever-changing environment. This has caused many in the scientific community to claim we are in the middle of a 6th mass extinction. Secondly, the prevalence of CO2 gas in the atmosphere allows algae to spread rapidly throughout our oceans in a process known as "eutrophication". If left unchecked, they could easily drive many marine species to extinction and increase toxicity levels in our oceans. Third, melting ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica may increase sea level by up to several feet, submerging entire coastal cities and island nations beneath the waters. Finally, an increased risk of natural disasters can lead to drought and famine across the entire agricultural world, which could quickly escalate into resource wars and conflict between rich and poor.

Therefore, it is for these reasons that we have decided to choose climate change as our topic for our first 2 quarters of Computer Science. üëè

<br> <strong> **II. Website Contents** </strong> <br>

Our website will comprised of the following:

1. Homepage - The homepage is the landing page of the website and will give an overview of the website and links to the other contents of the website.

2. Fossil Fuels 101 - This page will discuss what fossil fuels are and the industries that rely on them. Aside from this, this page will also tell us how big the impact of fossil fuels have on climate change and our planet. 

3. Deforestation - In this page, we will explain what deforestation is along with its relationship to climate change. 

4. Waste - In this page, we will tackle how waste plays a major role in contributing to climate change.

5. Solutions - Lastly, for this page, we will discuss the possible solutions and actions we can do to prevent and lessen the effects of climate change. We will also include lists of organizations that focus on environmental awareness and issues.
