        <hr>
        <p>
          According to National Geographic (2022), fossil fuels are
          the product of dead plants and animals that have
          pressurized underground for millions of years. When they
          died, some of their energy was stored, and through
          immense heat and pressure, this energy became
          compactified into the 3 fossil fuels we know of today:
          Coal, oil, and gas.
        </p>
        <div class="fuel-types">
          <div class="coal">
            <h1>COAL</h1>
            <img src="../images/coal-icon.png" 
              alt="Picture of coal" title="Coal">
            <p>
              Coal is mostly made up of fossilized plants and can
              be found buried in layers of sedimentary rock.
              Through a long process known as carbonization, these
              ancient plants are slowly crushed into ever denser
              rocks of coal. In general, the higher the
              carbonization, the more energy can be 
              harnessed from the coal. Unfortunately, mining coal
              can be dangerous as miners are usually exposed to
              high levels of toxic dust. Moreover, the carbon that
              plants capture is also stored in coal. When burned,
              this carbon can escape and release harmful
              greenhouse gases into the environment.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="oil">
            <h1>OIL</h1>
            <img src="../images/oil-icon.png" 
              alt="Picture of an oil tank" title="Oil">
            <p>
              Oil, also called petroleum, is made out of dead
              plants and animals that have been heated and
              pressurized below ground. Oil deposits can usually
              be found in rock formations, under the ocean floor,
              or even on the surface where oil bubbles form. On
              land, drill rigs allow oil to be produced 24/7,
              making it a reliable source of energy for most. On
              sea, oil platforms are constructed to facilitate the
              extraction of oil from our oceans. Once refined, oil
              can be used for many things like providing fuel for
              your car. But, just like coal, burning gasoline
              releases stored up carbon into the atmosphere.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="gas">
            <h1>GAS</h1>
            <img src="../images/gas-icon.png"
              alt="Picture of a gas burner" title="Gas">
            <p>
              Similar to oil, gas (or natural gas) is formed when
              ancient species decompose over millions of years.
              The main difference being that natural gas is
              primarily made out of methane; another potent
              greenhouse gas. However, deposits of natural gas
              are spread thinly in layers of rock, forcing
              companies to use a process known as hydraulic
              fracturing or fracking for short. This involves
              using water and acid to dissolve these rocks in
              order to release natural gas for capturing.
              Natural gas can also be converted into liquid,
              providing a cleaner energy source compared to the
              previous two fossil fuels.

          According to Our World in Data (2019), a whopping 84%
          of our energy and 64% of our electricity came from
          fossil fuels alone. We rely on fossil fuels for so many
          of our basic needs like cooking, heating, fuel, lights,
          and so much more. If we stopped using them, society as a
          whole would collapse unless we can find some way to
          lessen our dependence.

          <p>
            For its entire history, fossil fuel consumption in
            the Philippines has continued to increase at a rapid
            rate. In fact, our consumption has nearly doubled in
            the past 2 decades alone, reaching a peak of nearly
            500 terrawatts. However, this has both good and bad
            consequences. The good news is that more fossil fuels
            means more energy to fuel the development and
            economic growth of our country. The more developed we
            are, the higher our quality of life. The bad news is
            that more fossil fuels also means more carbon
            emitted. This leads to a phenomenon known as global
            warming which can have disastrous effects for our
            nation if left unchecked. In an ironic twist of fate,
            fossil fuels, the same thing we used to industrialize
            and advance our society to where it is now, may be the
            one to end it in the future.

          To sum things up, fossil fuels are formed from ancient
          plants and animals that have been heated and pressurized
          over the years. The energy and carbon stored within them
          are released when they are burned, making fossil fuels
          both a useful source of electricity and a harmful source
          of greenhouse gases. Our reliance on fossil fuels has
          caused demand to skyrocket, exacerbating both climate
          change and global warming due to carbon dioxide in the
          atmosphere. As the Earth continues to warm and the
          situation grows desperate,
