        <p>
            Deforestation is the purposeful clearing of wide area of trees. Throughout time, up to the present, forests have been wiped out to make space for the facilitation of human activities. Activities such as agriculture and animal grazing, obtaining wood for fuel and paper production, manufacturing, and construction. <br> <br>
          
            Today, tropical rainforests are experiencing the highest deforestation, which is aided by massive road development into previously almost inaccessible areas. They say that, forests become more exploitable when highways are constructed or upgraded through them. Slash-and-burn agriculture, a method of agriculture wherein trees and shrubs are cleared and burned to create cropland, is a big contributor to deforestation in the tropics. This agricultural method make farmers burn big areas of forest, the ash being used later as fertilizer for the crops. However, this land is only fertile for a few years, and when ‘that’ few years is done, the farmers will move on to a different area, and repeat the process. With this being said, deforestation is done repeatedly in an inconvenient manner. Furthermore, tropical rainforests are also cleared to make way for oil palm and rubber tree plantations, logging, and cattle ranching. <br> <br> <br>

          <h2> HERE ARE 15 “DID YOU KNOW?” STATEMENTS REAGARDING DEFORESTATION </h2>
          <ol>
        <li>
          31% of the earth’s surface is covered by forests, approximately 4.06 billion hectares <br> 
        </li>
        <li>
          Only 18% of the world's forests are on land protected from deforestation. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Over 420 million hectares of forest have been lost since 1990. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Between 1990-2010 an average of 15.5 million hectares of forest were destroyed every year. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Between 2010-2015 12 million hectares of forest were destroyed every year giving a 22.58% decline for 2010-2015 compared to 1990-2010.<br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Between 2015-2020 10 million hectares of forest were destroyed every year giving a 35.48% decline for 2015-2020 compared to 1990-2010 and 16.67% decline compared to 2010-2015. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          2,400 trees are cut down each minute. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Currently, the most widespread deforestation is occurring in the Amazon rainforest located in South America.  <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          25.8 million hectares of forest were lost in 2020, double the amount of forested land lost in 2001. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Tropical deforestation contributes about 20% of annual global greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Prior to 2019, greenhouse gas emission from tropical forest degradation was seriously underestimated. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
         In 2019, approximately 9 million acres of rainforests were destroyed. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Deforestation causes approximately $2 trillion to $4.5 trillion in lost biodiversity each year. 137 different species of plants, animals, and birds are lost every single day due to global forest loss. <br> <br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Approximately 1,400 tree species are currently listed as critically endangered. <br> <br>
        </li>   
        <li>
          90 percent of people who live in extreme poverty depend on forests for their survival.

        <p>
          Deforestation occurs deliberately, naturally, or accidentally, and can happen anywhere in densely populated land. Below is a list of causes of deforestation and their effects. Take time to read it and better, reflect on your actions. Did I contribute to deforestation without realizing it? 
          <h2>CAUSES 101</h2>
          There are a lot of possible causes of deforestation. These are the four most common ones. <br> <br>
              
              1. Forests cleared to build factories, businesses, or homes. <br> <br>
              
              2. Forests cleared for agriculture and farmland. (paper mills and sugar refineries) <br> <br> 
              
              3. Forests cleared to create pastures for livestock. <br> <br> 
              
              4. Forests burned by wildfires.
          
          <h2>EFFECTS 101</h2>
          
              1. Atmospheric Effects of Deforestation (Climate change and global warming) – We all know from our science class that trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. As trees are cut down, this carbon dioxide is later on released back to the atmosphere increasing the amount of greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere. As a result, global warming. <br> <br>
              
              2. Atmospheric Water –Trees take part in controlling the level of water found in the atmosphere. As trees are cut down, there is less water available in the atmosphere for the soil to absorb. This results to drier soil and will no longer support agriculture and cattle ranching. <br> <br>
              
              3. Loss of Habitat – 80% of Earth’s known animal and plant species live in forests. Forests’ trees provide shelter, while its canopy helps regulate temperature and light. These trees removed result in a change in temperature and increased sunlight, and this might be fatal for all forest animal and plant species. Overall, this loss of habitat can result in the endangerment or extinction of known species, and worst, the loss of unknown species. A decrease in global biodiversity is also evident. 
<br> <br>

           4. Flooding and Soil Erosion – Almost every plant species, may it be underground, tree, shrub, bush, and grassroots, all work together to prevent soil erosion. Without trees, the ground becomes barren and more vulnerable to flooding as valuable topsoil erodes and washes away.

NOTES for this week's commit : For this weeks's commit, I already started putting on the content for my webpage (deforestation). We are already done with the homepage part and now we are just finishing the two webpages required for the first quarter. In my case, a little more content and then finishing touches (codes and stuff) and I think I'm good to go.
